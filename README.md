## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of projects developed using Rust. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates different features and capabilities of the Rust programming language.

## Projects

1. **File Compressor**
   - Description: File compressor is a Rust-based utility that shrinks files by applying compression algorithms. It reduces storage requirements and transmission times, making it ideal for efficient data management.

2. **File UnZipper**
   - Description: File unzipper is a Rust-based utility that unzips the zipped file with maintaining the similar directory and file structure as in zipped file.

   - [More details](https://github.com/charankulal/Rust-Projects/tree/master/decompressor)

3. **CSV Reader**
   - Description: CSV reader will read out the contents in the csv(comma separated values) file and log them in the terminal.

   - [More details](https://github.com/charankulal/Rust-Projects/tree/master/csv_reader)

4. **JSON Reader**
   - Description: JSON reader will read out the contents in the json format and log them in the terminal.

   - [More details](https://github.com/charankulal/Rust-Projects/tree/master/read_json)

5. **JSON Writer**
   - Description: JSON writer will convert the text contents into the json format and log them in the terminal.
